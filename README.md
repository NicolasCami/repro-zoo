# repro-zoo

This repo continues the work we started at the SEG Repro Zoo in Anaheim in 2018. [Repository available.](https://github.com/seg/repro-zoo-2018)

üí° **Our goal is to reproduce useful and interesting work in the subsurface domain.**

The purpose of this is manifold:

- Check the reproducibility of work in our field, both for papers aiming to be reproducible, and those that are not.
- If the work was not open, make it available to a wider audience in a more useful format (code!).
- Highlight the importance of reproducibility in our field.

‚ùì Any questions, check out the **#repro-zoo** channel in [the Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org/slack).


## What is a reproduction?

Each folder contains a reproduction. In general, this should consist of:

- One or more Notebooks, or a `README.md` file, with the citation, a link to the complete paper (eg as a pre-print) or at least a DOI, and any notes about what you're trying to do or what is interesting about the paper.
- More code files or notebooks, whatever is needed or makes sense to you.
- Any data, or links to data, you need. This might be ripped from a table in the paper, or you might link to the author's repo.
- Your code.
- A `LICENSE` file is optional; if you don't include one you will be included in the Apache 2.0 license attached to this repo.
- Anything else you think is important.


## Contribute a reproduction

**There is a list of papers to reproduce in [the Issues](https://github.com/softwareunderground/repro-zoo/issues).**

But don't limit yourself to those. You are welcome to tackle any paper related to subsurface science and engineering. 

If you would rather host the reproduction yourself, e.g. on your own account, GitLab, gist, or whatever, then please feel free to add a folder here containing a `README` that points to your work. E.g. see [this example](https://github.com/softwareunderground/repro-zoo/tree/main/wheeler-and-hale-2015).


## Please be careful with people's property

- Be very clear about attaching original attribution to your work. 
- Respect the licenses that other's have attached to their work. For example, you can't include someone's GPL code in your CC BY reproduction, use CC BY-SA instead. If in doubt, ask someone in [the Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org/slack).
- Please don't check in a PDF of the paper itself (even if it is open), or include a large amount of it as images etc. A few figures or table is fine (fair use).**
